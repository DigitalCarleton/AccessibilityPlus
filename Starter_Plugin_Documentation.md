### Models, Views, and Controllers

"The Model-View-Controller pattern is designed to help manage the tasks of describing an object in the database (Model), managing the retrieval and manipulation of that data (Controller), and formatting it for display (View). Keeping these three areas separate makes it easier to understand, maintain, and develop your code. Not every plugin will need to make use of this architecture, but for complex tasks it is essential to understand."

See Omeka's [1.x documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20170728215119/http://omeka.org:80/codex/MVC_Pattern_and_URL_Paths_in_Omeka) on the web archiver for further information on Models, Views, and Controllers.
